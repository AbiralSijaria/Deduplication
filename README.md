# Hotels-50K

The Hotels-50K dataset consists of over 1 million images from 50,000 different hotels around the world. These images come from both travel websites, as well as the TraffickCam mobile application, which allows every day travelers to submit images of their hotel room in order to help combat sex trafficking.

## Downloading the dataset
There are two steps to downloading the Hotels-50K dataset. First, you'll need to download the JSON files that include the hotel metadata and image URLs. These can be found at:

* train: https://todo.com/train_set.json
* test: https://todo.com/test_set.json

Once you've downloaded these json files, you can use the `input/download_train.py` and `input/download_test.py` scripts to download the train and test images to images/train and images/test, respectively.
